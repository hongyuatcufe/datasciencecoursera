CODEBOOK

This file illustrate the information of variables included in data.csv
The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 'time' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (time_body_acc_xyz and time_gravity_acc_xyz) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (time_body_acc_jerk_xyz and time_body_gyro_jerk_xyz). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (time_body_acc_mag, time_gravity_acc_mag, time_body_acc_jerk_mag, time_body_gyro_mag, time_body_Gyro_jerk_mag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing freq_body_acc_xyz, freq_body_acc_jerk_xyz, freq_body_gyro_xyz, freq_body_acc_jerk_mag, freq_body_gyro_mag, freq_body_gyro_jerk_mag. (Note the 'freq' to indicate frequency domain signals).
